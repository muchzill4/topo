# Topo

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/arm/topo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/arm/topo)

Discover what your Arm hardware can do, find software that unlocks its potential, and deploy it in minutes with standard container tooling.

Point Topo at an Arm Linux system over SSH and it can:

- probe the hardware, identifying CPU features and heterogeneous coprocessors
- match your system with [Compose](https://compose-spec.io/)-based [Topo Templates](https://github.com/arm/topo-template-format) that showcase those features
- build, transfer, and launch workloads with an idempotent `topo deploy` workflow

Use Topo Templates to go from a fresh Linux install to a working demo in minutes. Already have a Docker Compose project? Deploy it as-is and iterate without rebuilding your workflow around a new tool.

For boards with heterogeneous processors, Topo goes further. A template like [Lightbulb Moment](https://github.com/Arm-Examples/topo-lightbulb-moment) reads GPIO on the M-core, passes messages to the A-core, and serves a web UI, all deployed with one command. Under the hood, Topo and [remoteproc-runtime](https://github.com/arm/remoteproc-runtime) orchestrate Linux services and coprocessor firmware in the same Compose project, so you can treat a heterogeneous board as one deployable unit instead of juggling separate toolchains.

## Core Concepts

### Host and Target

Topo operates across two machines:

- **Host machine** — your laptop, workstation, or CI runner where you run the `topo` CLI. It connects to the target over SSH and builds container images locally.
- **Target machine** — a remote Arm Linux system (e.g. Raspberry Pi, custom SoC, cloud Graviton instance) reachable over SSH. Topo deploys and runs containerized workloads on this machine.

Commands that connect to the target accept a `--target` flag with an SSH destination (`user@host` or an SSH config alias). Set `TOPO_TARGET` once in your environment to skip repeating it:

```sh
export TOPO_TARGET=user@my-board
```

If host and target are the same system, use `--target localhost`.

### Target Description

The `topo describe` command probes your board and writes a `target-description.yaml` that captures CPU features, core topology, and any heterogeneous processors.

### Templates

Topo templates extend the [Compose Specification](https://compose-spec.io/) popularised by Docker, adding `x-topo` metadata that declares CPU feature requirements and build arguments. Topo uses your target description to match and configure compatible templates for your board. Templates can come from a git repository (`git:https://...`), or a local directory (`dir:path`).

The full format specification is at [arm/topo-template-format](https://github.com/arm/topo-template-format).

## Installation

Download the latest binary for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/arm/topo/releases/latest), extract it, and place it on your `PATH`.

### Prerequisites

**Host machine** (where you run `topo`):

- SSH client (`ssh`)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

**Target machine** (the remote Arm system):

- Linux on ARM64
- Docker
- `lscpu` (typically pre-installed; used for hardware probing)
- SSH server

The host and target can be the same system. If you're working directly on an Arm Linux system, use `--target localhost`.

## Getting Started

This walkthrough takes you from first connection to a running deployment. The examples use `my-board` as the SSH destination — replace it with your own `user@host` or SSH config alias, or set `TOPO_TARGET` once to skip repeating it:

```sh
export TOPO_TARGET=user@my-board
```

### 1. Check that everything is ready

```sh
topo health --target my-board
```

```
Host

SSH: ✅ (ssh)
Container Engine: ✅ (docker)

Target

Connectivity: ✅
Container Engine: ✅ (docker)
Hardware Info: ✅ (lscpu)
Remoteproc Runtime: ⚠️ (remoteproc-runtime not found on path)

```

- ⚠️ can be resolved to unlock full functionality.
- ℹ️ are informational and won't block the core workflow.

### 2. Describe your target hardware

```sh
topo describe --target my-board
```

This SSHs into the target, probes CPU features, and writes a `target-description.yaml` in the current directory. Topo uses this file to match your system to compatible templates.

### 3. Find a template

```sh
topo templates --target-description target-description.yaml
```

This lists available templates and indicates compatibility with your target hardware.
If you don't already have a target description file for your board, you can still use:

```sh
topo templates --target my-board
```

### 4. Clone a template into a new project

You can use `topo clone` with a git url, or file source. Git urls for our example templates can be found in the output of `topo templates`

```sh
topo clone https://github.com/Arm-Examples/topo-welcome.git
```

If the template requires build arguments, Topo will prompt you for them. You can also supply them on the command line:

```sh
topo clone https://github.com/Arm-Examples/topo-welcome.git GREETING_NAME="World"
```

This creates a project directory containing a `compose.yaml`, and any source files from the template.

### 5. Deploy to your target

```sh
cd topo-welcome/
topo deploy --target my-board
```

Topo builds the container images on your host, transfers them to the target over SSH, and starts the services.

### 6. Stop the deployment

When you're done, stop the running services:

```sh
topo stop --target my-board
```

## Other Commands

The Getting Started walkthrough above covers the core flow. These additional commands are available:

| Command                      | When to use it                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `init`                       | Scaffold a new empty project instead of cloning a template                                                  |
| `extend`                     | Add services from a template into an existing project                                                       |
| `service remove`             | Remove a service from your compose file                                                                     |
| `setup-keys`                 | Set up SSH key authentication if your target currently uses password-based SSH, which Topo does not support |
| `install remoteproc-runtime` | Install the remoteproc runtime on your target                                                               |

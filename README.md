# Topo CLI

Discover what your Arm hardware can do and deploy workloads that use it to its full potential.

Every Arm system has a different mix of architecture features, and many include additional specialized processors alongside the main CPU. Topo connects to your target over SSH, probes its capabilities, and matches it to ready-made containerized workloads that fully leverage your specific hardware. Where a system has multiple processors, Topo can install companion runtimes like [remoteproc-runtime](https://github.com/arm/remoteproc-runtime) to extend container workloads across all of them.

## Core Concepts

### Host and Target

Topo operates across two machines:

- **Host machine** — your laptop, workstation, or CI runner where you run the `topo` CLI. It connects to the target over SSH and builds container images locally.
- **Target machine** — a remote Arm Linux system (e.g. Raspberry Pi, custom SoC, cloud Graviton instance) reachable over SSH. Topo deploys and runs containerized workloads on this machine.

Commands that connect to the target accept a `--target` flag with an SSH destination (`user@host` or an SSH config alias). Set `TOPO_TARGET` once in your environment to skip repeating it:

```sh
export TOPO_TARGET=user@my-board
```

If host and target are the same system, use `--target localhost`.

### Target Description

The `topo describe` command probes your board and writes a `target-description.yaml` that captures CPU features, core topology, and any heterogeneous processors.

### Templates

Topo templates extend the [Compose Specification](https://compose-spec.io/) popularised by Docker, adding `x-topo` metadata that declares CPU feature requirements and build arguments. Topo uses your target description to match and configure compatible templates for your board. Templates can come from the built-in catalog (`template:Name`), a git repository (`git:https://...`), or a local directory (`dir:path`).

The full format specification is at [arm/topo-template-format](https://github.com/arm/topo-template-format).

## Installation

Download the latest binary for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/arm/topo/releases/latest), extract it, and place it on your `PATH`.

To build from source instead (requires Go 1.26+):

```sh
go build ./cmd/topo
```

### Prerequisites

**Host machine** (where you run `topo`):

- SSH client (`ssh`)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

**Target machine** (the remote Arm system):

- Linux on ARM64
- Docker
- `lscpu` (typically pre-installed; used for hardware probing)
- SSH server

The host and target can be the same system. If you're working directly on an Arm Linux system, use `--target localhost`.

## Getting Started

This walkthrough takes you from first connection to a running deployment. The examples use `my-board` as the SSH destination — replace it with your own `user@host` or SSH config alias, or set `TOPO_TARGET` once to skip repeating it:

```sh
export TOPO_TARGET=user@my-board
```

### 1. Check that everything is ready

```sh
topo health --target my-board
```

```
Host
----
SSH: ✅ (ssh)
Container Engine: ✅ (docker)

Target
------
Connected: ✅
Container Engine: ✅ (docker)
Hardware Info: ✅ (lscpu)
Subsystem Driver (remoteproc): ❌
```

Every check should show ✅ except Subsystem Driver, which is only needed for heterogeneous-CPU templates. If a required check fails, resolve it before continuing.

### 2. Describe your target hardware

```sh
topo describe --target my-board
```

This SSHs into the target, probes CPU features, and writes a `target-description.yaml` in the current directory. Topo uses this file to match your system to compatible templates.

### 3. Find a template

```sh
topo templates --target my-board
```

This lists templates compatible with your target's hardware. Pass `--feature` to narrow it further (e.g. `--feature SVE`).

### 4. Clone a template into a new project

```sh
topo clone my-project template:Hello-World
```

If the template requires build arguments, Topo will prompt you for them. You can also supply them on the command line:

```sh
topo clone my-project template:Hello-World GREETING_NAME="World"
```

This creates a `my-project/` directory containing a `compose.yaml`, and any source files from the template.

### 5. Deploy to your target

```sh
cd my-project/
topo deploy --target my-board
```

Topo builds the container images on your host, transfers them to the target over SSH, and starts the services.

### 6. Stop the deployment

When you're done, stop the running services:

```sh
topo stop --target my-board
```

## Other Commands

The Getting Started walkthrough above covers the core flow. These additional commands are available:

| Command              | When to use it                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `init`               | Scaffold a new empty project instead of cloning a template                                                  |
| `extend`             | Add services from a template into an existing project                                                       |
| `service remove`     | Remove a service from your compose file                                                                     |
| `setup-keys`         | Set up SSH key authentication if your target currently uses password-based SSH, which Topo does not support |
| `install remoteproc` | Install the remoteproc runtime on your target                                                               |

Run `topo <command> --help` for full usage details.

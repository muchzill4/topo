This command performs the following operations in sequence:
  1. Build - Builds Container images defined in the compose file on the local host
  2. Pull - Pulls any required images from registries to the local host
  3. Transfer - Transfers built and pulled images and compose file to the target host
  4. Run - Runs docker compose up on the target host

The compose file (compose.yaml) must be in the current working directory, as this is used to select the containers to be deployed.

Use --dry-run to see what commands would be executed without actually running them.`,

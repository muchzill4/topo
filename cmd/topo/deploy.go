This command performs the following operations in sequence:
  1. Build - Builds Container images defined in the compose file on the local host
  2. Pull - Pulls any required images from registries to the local host
  3. Transfer - Transfers built and pulled images and compose file to the target host
  4. Run - Runs docker compose up on the target host

The compose file (compose.yaml) is assumed to be in the current working directory,
similar to how 'docker compose' works without the -f flag.

Use --dry-run to see what commands would be executed without actually running them.`,
